Ayrshire & Arran,"In the December 2022 release, 85 historical waiting list records were removed from the data. These are records that have been removed in local waiting lists and reports but there is no facility in TrakCare to amend the records and exclude them for the national data submission and subsequent publication. All 85 records were incorrectly showing as having long waits. A manual exclusion has been agreed with PHS to remove these records until system developments allow retrospective record adjustments to properly correct the submission data."
Borders,"NHS Borders are investigating data quality issues affecting their submissions to the national data warehouse. The full impact of this is not yet known, therefore most data have been excluded until investigations are concluded and the data is corrected. Data for Physiotherapy and Chiropody/Podiatry from April to June 2023 are included in this release."
Borders,NHS Borders do not provide a MSK Occupational Therapy Service.
Dumfries & Galloway,"NHS Dumfries & Galloway have advised that following the rollout of ACRT (Advanced Clinical Referral Triage) across AHP-MSK services, there may be a data quality issue with how this is recorded. This is being investigated by the health intelligence team and amended data will be included in future publications if necessary."
